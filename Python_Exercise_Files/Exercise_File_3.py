## given the below list:

numbers=[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,14,15,17,18,20]

# using the for loop and the conditional statement create a new list empty list and include only the even numbers in it


### given the below counter with the help of  while loop that print odd number to 300

count=3


## think caefully how to increase the count value in the loop to get only the odd numbers
