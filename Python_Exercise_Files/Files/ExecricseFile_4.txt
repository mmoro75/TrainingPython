The ice cream division, whose other brands include Viennetta, Carte d'Or, Cornetto and Breyers, achieved global sales of €7.9bn (£6.75bn) last year.
However, Unilever said the business had less in common with its other consumer product lines because it needed a frozen goods supply chain and was more seasonal.
"The separation of ice cream and the delivery of the productivity programme will help create a simpler, more focused, and higher performing Unilever," said the company's chairman Ian Meakins.
"It will also create a world-leading ice cream business, with strong growth prospects and an exciting future as a standalone business."

An American pilot, caught over the alcohol limit before he was due to fly a passenger plane from Edinburgh to New York, has been jailed for 10 months.
Lawrence Russell, 63, was searched by airport security officers at about 09:15 on 16 June last year.
He was found to have two bottles of Jägermeister in his carry on luggage - one of which was half full.
A breath test revealed the Delta Airlines captain was more than twice the legal alcohol limit for pilots.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard Russell, from Georgia, has been treated for alcoholism.
Delta has been contacted for comment.
Delta pilot over alcohol limit before Edinburgh to New York flight
The court heard Russell had not less than 49mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood.
This exceeded the strict legal limit which is 20mg of alcohol.
Sheriff Alison Stirling said a prison sentence had to be imposed as a punishment and for the "protection of the public".
The court previously heard the pilot was to take controg 767 flight from Edinburgh Airport to JFK Airport in New York, which was due to take off at 10:35.
His bags were selected for inspection by security staff who were said to have "noted Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform, a lanyard around his neck and

This exceeded the strict legal limit which is 20mg of alcohol.
Sheriff Alison Stirling said a prison sentence had to be imposed as a punishment and for the "protection of the public".
The court previously heard the pilot was to take control of a Boeing 767 flight from Edinburgh Airport to JFK Airport in New York, which was due to take off at 10:35.
His bags were selected for inspection by security staff who were said to have "noted Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform, a lanyard around his neck and a Delta Airline crew pass".
Fiscal depute Matthew Millar told the court one of the bottles had been opened and was "half full".
Mr Millar said: "Given Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform the police were contacted.
"Mr Rusell identified himself to the constables and said he was the captain of the aircraft."
He provided police with a sample of breath and, after being arrested, was taken to Livingston police station, West Lothian, where he provided a blood sample.
The fiscal depute said when Russell was cautioned and charged he told officers: "I'm terrified".
Following the pilot's arrest, the flight to New York was cancelled and Delta Airlines confirmed all the passengers were then helped with their travel plans.
'Reckless disregard'
On Tuesday the court heard the father-of-two also has two previous convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol in the US.
Defence lawyer Pamela Rodgers said her client was a recovering alcoholic who had not drunk alcohol for 277 days and had completed the 12 Steps to Recovery rehab programme.
Ms Rodgers said Russell was just the fourth pilot to be prosecuted in Scotland for attempting to fly while under the influence of alcohol and was "remorseful"

armite and Dove soap-owner Unilever is to cut about 7,500 jobs worldwide, as part of an extensive three-year cost-saving plan.
The group also said it would split off its ice cream business which includes the Wall's, Ben & Jerry's and Magnum brands.
The food and household goods giant said the spin-off will start immediately and should be completed by the end of 2025.
Unilever said the shake-up would help it to "do fewer things better".
The job cuts, which Unilever said would mostly affect office staff, represent more than 5% of its 128,000 global workforce and are aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years.
Unilever employs 6,000 staff in the UK including producing ice cream in north-east Gloucestershire, Marmite and Bovril in Burton-on-Trent and Pot Noodles in Newport.

armite and Dove soap-owner Unilever is to cut about 7,500 jobs worldwide, as part of an extensive three-year cost-saving plan.
The group also said it would split off its ice cream business which includes the Wall's, Ben & Jerry's and Magnum brands.
The food and household goods giant said the spin-off will start immediately and should be completed by the end of 2025.
Unilever said the shake-up would help it to "do fewer things better".
The job cuts, which Unilever said would mostly affect office staff, represent more than 5% of its 128,000 global workforce and are aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years.
Unilever employs 6,000 staff in the UK including producing ice cream in north-east Gloucestershire, Marmite and Bovril in Burton-on-Trent and Pot Noodles in Newport.

Lynne Barrie, procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders, said: "Lawrence Russell's conduct would have endangered many lives; the consequences could have been catastrophic.
"He showed a reckless disregard for the safety of his passengers and crew. The pilot of a commercial aircraft holds the lives of hundreds in his hands. He would have put all of them at serious risk.
"This conviction should send the message that crimes of this nature will be robustly dealt with."
